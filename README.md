# recipe-retrieval-system
The Recipe Retrieval System is a web-based application that allows users to enter a list of available ingredients and receive a list of matching recipes. The system is designed to provide accurate, fast, and personalized recipe recommendations while integrating third-party APIs for enhanced functionality. 
This project focuses on backend development, ensuring a scalable, efficient, and well-documented API for recipe retrieval. The front end will serve as a minimal interface to interact with the backend.
## 🚀 Features
**Ingredient-Based Recipe Search** – Users enter ingredients, and the system returns the best-matching recipes.  
**Database-Driven Recipe Storage** – Recipes and ingredients are stored and managed in a structured database.  
**User Authentication (Optional)** – Users can **register, login, and save** their favorite recipes.  
**Recipe Ranking Algorithm** – The system ranks recipes based on **matching percentage and missing ingredients**.  
**Third-Party API Integration** – (Optional) Uses **Spoonacular API** or **Edamam API** for extended recipe options.  
**Fast & Scalable API** – Built with **Node.js & Express.js**, supporting **RESTful architecture**.  
**Secure Input Validation** – Prevents incorrect inputs and ensures **data consistency**.
